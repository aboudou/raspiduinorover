Raspberry Pi model B
 - TL-WN723N USB Wireless adapter
 - Raspberry Pi camera module
 - No keyboard, no HMDI / composite display
 - No overclock
 - Arduino UNO through I2C connection

Arduino UNO + Arduino Motor Shield

In this case, motors of tracked chassis are powered by the common power rail.



Current usage was measured at the input of the common power rail, thus measuring current usage of
 - Raspberry Pi
 - Arduino Uno
 - Arduino Motor Shield
 - Pan / Tilt servos
 - Lighting module
 - Tracked chassis motors



Idle mode is when nobody is connected to the rover:
 - Raspberry Pi does not communicate with Arduino UNO
 - Raspberry Pi camera module is stopped
 - Tracked chassis motors are stopped
 - Pan / Tilt servos are detached from Arduino (a.k.a. no signal on control pins)
 - Lighting module is switched off

Active mode is when someone is connected to the rover:
 - Raspberry Pi regularly get status from Arduino UNO (every 0.5 seconds)
 - Raspberry Pi camera module is running, with active streaming
 - Tracked chassis motors may be running
 - Pan / Tilt servos are attached to Arduino (a.k.a. signal on control pins), and may be moving
 - Lighting module may be switched on



Results:

idle mode  : 180 mA

active mode: 310 mA streaming (user just connected, no action)
             330 mA streaming + lights on
             340 mA streaming + servo moving
             360 mA streaming + servo moving + lights on
             450 mA streaming + motors running
             470 mA streaming + motors running + lights on
